# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

**This is an example of how to create a minimal pipeline for SAM based Serverless Apps**

![Pipeline Sample Image](pipeline-sample.png)

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator access
    - Alternatively, you can use a [Cloudformation Service Role with Admin access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-servicerole.html)
{%- if cookiecutter.source_code_repo == "Github" %}
* [Github Personal Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) with full permissions on **admin:repo_hook and repo**

## Configuring GitHub Integration

This Pipeline is configured to look up for GitHub information stored on [EC2 System Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html) such as Branch, Repo, Username and OAuth Token.

Replace the placeholders with values corresponding to your GitHub Repo and Token:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/service/{{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}/github/repo" \
    --description "Github Repository name for Cloudformation Stack {{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "GITHUB_REPO_NAME"

aws secretsmanager create-secret --name GithubToken \
    --description "Github Token for Cloudformation Stack {{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}-pipeline" \
    --secret-string "TOKEN"

ARN=$(aws secretsmanager list-secrets --query 'SecretList[?Name==`GithubToken`].{arn:ARN}' --output text)

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/service/{{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}/github/token_arn_suffix" \
    --description "Secrets Manager ARN Suffix for the Github OAuth Token for Cloudformation Stack {{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "${ARN##*:}"

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/service/{{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}/github/user" \
    --description "Github Username for Cloudformation Stack {{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "GITHUB_USER"
```

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that these Parameters will only be available within the same region you're deploying this Pipeline stack. Also, if these values ever change you will need to [update these parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/put-parameter.html) as well as update the "{{cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}}-pipeline" Cloudformation stack.

## Pipeline creation

<details>
<summary>If you don't use Python or don't want to trigger the Pipeline from the `master` branch click here...</summary>
Before we create this 3-environment Pipeline through Cloudformation you may want to change a couple of things to fit your environment/runtime:

* **CodeBuild** uses a `Python` build image by default and if you're not using `Python` as a runtime you can change that
    - [CodeBuild offers multiple images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html) and you can  update the `Image` property under `pipeline.yaml` file accordingly

```yaml
    CodeBuildProject:
        Type: AWS::CodeBuild::Project
        Properties:
            ...
            Environment:
                Type: LINUX_CONTAINER
                ComputeType: BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL
                Image: aws/codebuild/python:3.6.5 # More info on Images: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html
                EnvironmentVariables:
                  -
                    Name: BUILD_OUTPUT_BUCKET
                    Value: !Ref BuildArtifactsBucket
...
```

* **CodePipeline** uses the `master` branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline and if you want to specify another branch you can do so by updating the following section in the `pipeline.yaml` file.

{%- if cookiecutter.source_code_repo == "Github" %}
```yaml
    Stages:
        - Name: Source
            Actions:
            - Name: SourceCodeRepo
                ActionTypeId:
                # More info on Possible Values: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements
                Category: Source
                Owner: ThirdParty
                Provider: GitHub
                Version: "1"
                Configuration:
                Owner: !Ref GithubUser
                Repo: !Ref GithubRepo
                Branch: master
                OAuthToken: !Ref GithubToken
                OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceCodeAsZip
                RunOrder: 1
```
{%- else %}
```yaml
...
    Stages:
        - Name: Source
            Actions:
            - Name: SourceCodeRepo
                ActionTypeId:
                # More info on Possible Values: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements
                Category: Source
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeCommit
                Version: 1
                Configuration:
                RepositoryName: !GetAtt CodeRepository.Name
                BranchName: master
                OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceCodeAsZip
                RunOrder: 1
```
{%- endif %}
</details>

Run the following AWS CLI command to create your first pipeline for your SAM based Serverless App:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }}-pipeline \
    --template-body file://pipeline.yaml \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

This may take a couple of minutes to complete, therefore give it a minute or two and then run the following command to retrieve the Git repository:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }}-pipeline \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Release through the newly built Pipeline

Although CodePipeline will orchestrate this 3-environment CI/CD pipeline we need to learn how to integrate our toolchain to fit the following sections:

> **Source code**

All you need to do here is to initialize a local `git repository` for your existing service if you haven't done already and connect to the `git repository` that you retrieved in the previous section.

```bash
git init
```

Next, add a new Git Origin to connect your local repository to the remote repository:

{%- if cookiecutter.source_code_repo == "Github" %}
* [Git Instructions for HTTPS access](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/)
{%- else %}
* [Git Instructions for SSH access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html)
* [Git Instructions for HTTPS access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-https-unixes.html)
{%- endif %}

> **Build steps**

This Pipeline expects `buildspec.yaml` to be at the root of this `git repository` and **CodeBuild** expects will read and execute all sections during the Build stage.

Open up `buildspec.yaml` using your favourite editor and customize it to your needs - Comments have been added to guide you what's needed

> **Triggering a deployment through the Pipeline**

The Pipeline will be listening for new git commits pushed to the `master` branch (unless you changed), therefore all we need to do now is to commit to master and watch our pipeline run through:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Kicking the tires of my first CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin master
```
